title: Style Change
---

Just noting that I changed the color of the titlebar from black to white.  If you have any suggestions to make this site better, shoot them my way via [twitter][] or IRC.

If you have any other suggestions, e.g. a better title or a better 
description, go ahead and send those my way too.  This is really new.  I 
probably have a lot to learn about CSS.

### edit ###
- added the hr's at the bottom of the posts like on ozmm.org
- changed font-height in the title from 50px to 80px, so that there's no
  overlapping
